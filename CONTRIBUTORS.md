# Contributing to QuantDinger

QuantDinger is a **local-first, private AI-driven quantitative trading workspace**.

It is designed for people who care about:
- data sovereignty
- local execution
- transparent systems
- engineering over hype

This project is still early, but it is **real**:
real code, real users, real execution.

We welcome contributors who want to help build something long-term.

## ⚠️ Important Note (Please Read)

QuantDinger is **not a DAO**.
There is **no token**, **no airdrop**, and **no financial incentive** at this stage.

If you are looking for short-term rewards, promotions, or token speculation,
this project is probably **not a good fit**.

If you are interested in:
- building credible infrastructure
- publishing real work under your name
- shaping an early-stage system

then you are very welcome here.
